|`[CMSCipher                ] - Unable to decrypt data`|:bomb:|PI-006374|macOS - Configuration Profile - Security & Privacy Payload - FileVault Recovery Keys cannot be viewed if Certificate expired. Observation : Filevault 2 recovery keys are displayed in the JPS as a long string with hundreds of characters starting with 'MIAGCSqGSIb3DQEHA6CAMIACAQAxgg'. Jamf Pro has a FILEVAULT2COMM certificate in the database, and it is valid for 5 years. In case it needs to be renewed we hit this issue. Fixed with JPS 10.10. Can be manually resolved by we creating a new configuration profile with Security & Privacy Payload with Enable Escrow Personal Recovery Key selected and use a reissue script (https://github.com/JAMFSupport/FileVault2_Scripts/blob/master/reissueKey.sh)|
